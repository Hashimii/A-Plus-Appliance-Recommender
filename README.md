In this project, I utilized my SQL skills to manage and query energy provider and appliance data using SQL Server, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation. Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, I performed data manipulation and analysis to transform raw data into meaningful insights for energy cost comparisons and savings calculations. I employed Flask to build a dynamic web interface and integrated Plotly to create interactive and visually appealing charts, which displayed cost comparisons and potential savings, thereby enhancing the user experience. Additionally, I used Flask to quickly develop a responsive web application, allowing users to seamlessly interact with the platform and access energy optimization information. This project showcases my proficiency in SQL, Python, Flask, and Plotly as well as my ability to create comprehensive data-driven applications.
